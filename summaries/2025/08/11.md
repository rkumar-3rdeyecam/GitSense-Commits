# Activity Summary for 8/11/2025

## 5:44:05 PM
The provided code represents an AWS CDK stack (`opensearch-ingest-pipeline-stack.ts`)  that sets up an OpenSearch ingestion pipeline.  The key changes across the three commits involve modifications to the data processed within the pipeline's `processor` section.

The first commit (8/11/2025, 5:36:05 PM) defines the pipeline, establishing connections to DynamoDB as a source, S3 for dead-letter queues (DLQ) and export, OpenSearch Serverless as a sink, and CloudWatch for logging.  IAM roles and policies grant necessary permissions.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to configuring these permissions across various AWS services.  An S3 bucket (`s3ZeroETL`) is used, and a policy enforces SSL connections.  The stack also manages VPC settings and security groups.

The second commit (8/11/2025, 5:37:40 PM), made only one minute after the first, modifies the `include_keys` array within the pipeline's `processor`.  Specifically, the `infractionDetails` key is removed from this array.


The third commit (8/11/2025, 5:38:36 PM), a minute after the second,  re-adds `infractionDetails` but this time nests it within a `safety` object, resulting in `safety.infractionDetails`.  This suggests a change in data structure or handling of infraction details within the pipeline.

All three commits maintain the core structure of the pipeline. The primary difference lies in how the `infractionDetails` field is handled in the data transformation stage, highlighting an iterative refinement of data processing logic within a short timeframe.


## 6:44:06 PM
The log shows a series of changes to the `c:\ARK-Workspace\MS\microservice-safety\lambda\safetyPoints\index.ts` file between 8/11/2025, 5:46:54 PM and 8/11/2025, 6:24:04 PM.  These changes primarily focus on adding a mock event for testing purposes within the `safetyPointsHandler` function.  The initial version of the function processed real events. The subsequent commits introduce a `mockEvent` object, progressively adding details like media and review time to the use cases within the mock event. The `processEvent` variable is used to handle both mock and real events, prioritizing the mock event if available. Finally, the last commit reverts to the original code's structure for handling real events, removing the mock event implementation.  The `index.ts` file is a lambda function handler that processes safety events, calculating infraction scores and updating a DynamoDB table (`TABLE_SAFETY`). The `opensearch-ingest-pipeline-stack.ts` file, modified at 8/11/2025, 5:46:42 PM, defines an AWS CDK stack for managing an OpenSearch ingestion pipeline. This pipeline integrates with DynamoDB, S3, and OpenSearch Serverless.  It includes robust IAM role configuration granting necessary permissions for data access and pipeline operation, demonstrating attention to security best practices.  Suppressions are added for CDK-NAG rules related to S3 bucket policies and IAM role permissions.  The pipeline configuration is detailed, specifying the source (DynamoDB), processors, sink (OpenSearch Serverless), and DLQ (S3)  The VPC and Security Groups are also explicitly defined and used.
