# Activity Summary for 8/11/2025

## 5:44:05 PM
The provided code represents an AWS CDK stack (`opensearch-ingest-pipeline-stack.ts`)  that sets up an OpenSearch ingestion pipeline.  The key changes across the three commits involve modifications to the data processed within the pipeline's `processor` section.

The first commit (8/11/2025, 5:36:05 PM) defines the pipeline, establishing connections to DynamoDB as a source, S3 for dead-letter queues (DLQ) and export, OpenSearch Serverless as a sink, and CloudWatch for logging.  IAM roles and policies grant necessary permissions.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to configuring these permissions across various AWS services.  An S3 bucket (`s3ZeroETL`) is used, and a policy enforces SSL connections.  The stack also manages VPC settings and security groups.

The second commit (8/11/2025, 5:37:40 PM), made only one minute after the first, modifies the `include_keys` array within the pipeline's `processor`.  Specifically, the `infractionDetails` key is removed from this array.


The third commit (8/11/2025, 5:38:36 PM), a minute after the second,  re-adds `infractionDetails` but this time nests it within a `safety` object, resulting in `safety.infractionDetails`.  This suggests a change in data structure or handling of infraction details within the pipeline.

All three commits maintain the core structure of the pipeline. The primary difference lies in how the `infractionDetails` field is handled in the data transformation stage, highlighting an iterative refinement of data processing logic within a short timeframe.
