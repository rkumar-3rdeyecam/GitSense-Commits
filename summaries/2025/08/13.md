# Activity Summary for 8/13/2025

## 4:53:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `safety-event-information-panel` component's HTML and SCSS files, and the `app.interceptor` file.

**`safety-event-information-panel.component.html`:** This file underwent several minor revisions between 2:55 PM and 3:25 PM.  The changes primarily involved minor adjustments to the HTML structure and conditional rendering based on permissions (`permissions['EditInfractionIcon']`, `permissions['SafetyEventDetails']`, etc.).  A section related to creating coaching sessions was commented out ("As Per the Ticket-5315...").  The core functionality and structure of the component remained consistent throughout these changes.

**`safety-event-information-panel.component.scss`:** This file was updated twice, at 2:57 PM and 3:19 PM. The changes focused on styling improvements, particularly for responsiveness and text wrapping within the `.event-type-text` class.  Specific additions include `overflow-wrap: break-word;`, `white-space: normal;`, and responsive font size adjustments for smaller screens. The second update added even more responsive styling targeting very small screens (max-width: 480px).

**`app.interceptor.ts`:** This file tracks API calls and handles HTTP responses.  The most significant change happened between 3:31 PM and 4:45 PM.  The `buildBaseUrl` function, which determines the API base URL based on the environment, was modified. The base URL for localhost environments changed from `https://api.test.ark.3rdeyecam.com/` to `https://api.dev.ark.3rdeyecam.com/` at 4:45 PM.  Earlier changes (between 3:31 PM and 3:39 PM) involved altering the default environment returned by `getArkEnv()` when running locally, switching between 'test' and 'dev'.  The error handling within the interceptor remained largely consistent, providing informative snackbar messages for various HTTP error codes (401, 403, 404).  The interceptor also uses `aws-amplify/auth` for authentication and token management.


## 7:54:17 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on `safety-event-information-panel.component.html` and `safety-event-information-panel.component.scss` files within the Angular application.  The `app.interceptor.ts` file also received updates but they are all identical except for one minor change in `getArkEnv` function's return value.


**app.interceptor.ts:** This file, an Angular HTTP interceptor,  manages authentication tokens and handles HTTP error responses.  The only change across multiple timestamps is within the `getArkEnv()` function where the return value for localhost changes from 'dev' to 'test'. This occurred between 5:01:58 PM and 5:03:17 PM. The interceptor displays snackbar messages for different HTTP error statuses (401, 403, 404), performs automatic sign-in on 401, and customizes error messages based on the error object's structure.


**safety-event-information-panel.component.html:** This component's HTML template underwent several revisions between 5:16:13 PM and 6:05:38 PM.  The main focus was on refining the display of infraction scores and adjusting the layout of the information panel.  Specifically, conditional rendering (`@if`) is extensively used to show/hide elements based on the presence of infractions, permissions (`permissions` object), and the `showMap` flag.  The `totalScore` variable is used to display the total score, and changes were made to improve how this score is shown and conditional rendering around the score display. A section related to "Create Coaching Session" was commented out  ("<!-- ... -->") as per Ticket-5315.  The changes involved removing and adding back the total score display multiple times throughout the edits of this component.


**safety-event-information-panel.component.scss:** This file contains the styling for the component.  Changes between 5:23:40 PM and 6:12:34 PM focused on cleaning up and simplifying the styles, removing some commented-out code (specifically the `score-and-edit-container`, `.event-type-text`, and `.total-score-text` styles and some responsive media queries were removed in the later commits.  The component uses Material Design components (mat-card, mat-icon-button, etc.) and incorporates responsive design elements using media queries.  The overall style is intended to manage the visual display of the information panel for safety events.


**Overall Pattern:** The modifications to the HTML template seem iterative, with changes focused on conditional display of elements and minor structural adjustments.  The styling adjustments suggest a move towards cleaner and possibly more maintainable CSS.  The changes to the interceptor were very minor and are unlikely to impact the functionality significantly.
