# Activity Summary for 8/13/2025

## 4:53:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `safety-event-information-panel` component's HTML and SCSS files, and the `app.interceptor` file.

**`safety-event-information-panel.component.html`:** This file underwent several minor revisions between 2:55 PM and 3:25 PM.  The changes primarily involved minor adjustments to the HTML structure and conditional rendering based on permissions (`permissions['EditInfractionIcon']`, `permissions['SafetyEventDetails']`, etc.).  A section related to creating coaching sessions was commented out ("As Per the Ticket-5315...").  The core functionality and structure of the component remained consistent throughout these changes.

**`safety-event-information-panel.component.scss`:** This file was updated twice, at 2:57 PM and 3:19 PM. The changes focused on styling improvements, particularly for responsiveness and text wrapping within the `.event-type-text` class.  Specific additions include `overflow-wrap: break-word;`, `white-space: normal;`, and responsive font size adjustments for smaller screens. The second update added even more responsive styling targeting very small screens (max-width: 480px).

**`app.interceptor.ts`:** This file tracks API calls and handles HTTP responses.  The most significant change happened between 3:31 PM and 4:45 PM.  The `buildBaseUrl` function, which determines the API base URL based on the environment, was modified. The base URL for localhost environments changed from `https://api.test.ark.3rdeyecam.com/` to `https://api.dev.ark.3rdeyecam.com/` at 4:45 PM.  Earlier changes (between 3:31 PM and 3:39 PM) involved altering the default environment returned by `getArkEnv()` when running locally, switching between 'test' and 'dev'.  The error handling within the interceptor remained largely consistent, providing informative snackbar messages for various HTTP error codes (401, 403, 404).  The interceptor also uses `aws-amplify/auth` for authentication and token management.
