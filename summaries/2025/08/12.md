# Activity Summary for 8/12/2025

## 12:03:48 AM
The log shows multiple updates to the `api_definition.yaml` file, describing an API for safety events.  The most significant changes are additions and modifications to API endpoints and their functionalities.  The first entry at 11:12:39 PM on 8/11/2025 details the initial API definition.  A subsequent update at 11:18:07 PM on the same day appears to be a minor revision, as the content is largely identical.

The `api_definition.yaml` file defines various API endpoints related to safety events:

* **GET /safety/{eventId}:** Retrieves a specific safety event by ID.
* **PUT /safety/{eventId}:** Updates a specific safety event.
* **PUT /safety/{eventId}/updateCoachingInfo:** Updates coaching information for a specific safety event.
* **GET /safety:** Lists safety events based on various search criteria (tenantId, divisionIds, assetId, driverId, address, status, startTime, endTime, pagination parameters, sorting, and filtering by coachId, coachingId, infractionScore, reviewStatus, eventName, metric, and eventTypes).
* **POST /safety:** Creates a new safety event (specifically for video requests).
* **PUT /safety:** Updates multiple safety events.
* **GET /safety/asset:** Retrieves safety events by asset ID.
* **GET /safety/driver:** Retrieves safety events by driver ID, optionally filtering for coaching events.


All endpoints utilize the same `x-amazon-apigateway-integration` pointing to  `'@@API_INTEGRATION_SAFETY_EVENT_API_LAMBDA@@'`, suggesting they are backed by a single AWS Lambda function. The endpoints consistently include `tenantId` and `divisionId` parameters, indicating a multi-tenant architecture.

The `safety-event-interfaces.ts` file, updated at 11:13:31 PM on 8/11/2025, defines TypeScript interfaces for various data structures used in the safety event microservice. These interfaces include search criteria, safety event representations (including placeholders and items), search results, review results, metrics records, infraction counts, and backend interfaces. The interfaces provide type safety and structure for data handling within the microservice.  The comprehensive nature of these interfaces suggests a robust and well-structured data model.


## 1:03:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `OpenSearchService.ts` and one revision to `SearchApiBackend.ts` between 12:24 AM and 12:56 AM on August 12th, 2025.  The `OpenSearchService.ts` file, which interacts with OpenSearch, underwent several minor revisions, primarily focused on the `infractionScore` field within the `SafetyEventMapping` interface.  Initially, `infractionScore` was of type `"keyword"`, but it was changed to `"integer"` and then back to `"keyword"` multiple times within a short period.  The final version maintains `"keyword"` type for `infractionScore`.

The `createSafetyEventIndex` function in `OpenSearchService.ts` remained largely consistent, creating or verifying an OpenSearch index with specified settings and mappings for safety events.  This function includes detailed logging using the `@aws-lambda-powertools/logger`.  The default settings for the index are one shard and one replica with a refresh interval of "1s" and the "best_compression" codec.


The changes to `SearchApiBackend.ts` at 12:56 AM involved a modification to the `buildOpenSearchQuery` function. Specifically, the way the sorting field was constructed was altered.  Instead of conditionally using  `getFieldForSorting(params.sortField)`, it now consistently uses `${params.sortField}.keyword` unless the field is `epochTimeOfEvent`.  This change simplifies the sorting logic in the OpenSearch query.


## 2:03:49 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `SearchApiBackend.ts` and one revision to `index.ts`.  The `SearchApiBackend.ts` file underwent several minor modifications between 1:06 AM and 1:15 AM on August 12th, 2025. These changes primarily focused on the `buildOpenSearchQuery` function within the file.  The core functionality remained consistent, but the implementation of sorting within the OpenSearch query was refined. Specifically, the line `[params.sortField && params.sortField !== "epochTimeOfEvent" ? `${params.sortField}.keyword` : params.sortField || "epochTimeOfEvent"]` was changed to `[params.sortField && params.sortField !== "epochTimeOfEvent" && params.sortField !== "infractionScore" ? `${params.sortField}.keyword` : params.sortField || "epochTimeOfEvent"]`  in the final revision, adding the condition `params.sortField !== "infractionScore"`. This suggests an enhancement to the sorting logic, potentially to handle numeric fields more accurately.  There was also a final revision at 1:41 AM removing some logging statements.

The `OpenSearchService.ts` file, modified at 1:16 AM, introduces functions for creating and managing OpenSearch indices.  It includes detailed mapping definitions for SafetyEvent data and utilizes AWS SDKs for interacting with OpenSearch Serverless. The code contains numerous comments suggesting potential areas for improvement and refactoring, particularly regarding code duplication and handling of response variables.

The `index.ts` file, updated at 1:53 AM and 1:53:56 AM, contains a Lambda handler (`safetyPointsHandler`) responsible for processing safety event data, calculating infraction scores, and updating a DynamoDB table.  The changes between the two revisions were not substantive. The function processes use case results, determines infraction scores and priority, and updates a DynamoDB table (`TABLE_SAFETY`) with the calculated scores and other event details.  The code includes error handling and logging mechanisms. There are comments flagging potential issues, such as the need to clean up some code related to `updateItem` requirements.


## 9:32:22 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `safety-event-table.component.html` and `safety-event-table.component.ts` files between 8:39 AM and 9:30 AM on August 12, 2025.  The `safety-event-filters.component.ts` file also underwent several revisions during a similar timeframe.

**`safety-event-table.component.html` Changes:**

The HTML file primarily displays a table of safety events.  Minor changes occurred between the first revision and the second, third and fourth  revisions; no substantive modifications were made.  The most significant change was in the last revision at 9:21:27 AM, where the header "Review Status1" was corrected to "Review Status".

**`safety-event-table.component.ts` Changes:**

The TypeScript file manages the safety event table's logic.  The key changes involved the `sortFieldMap` property.  Initially missing the `infractionScore` key, it was added at 8:59:21 AM, allowing sorting by infraction score.  Several revisions involved adding console.log statements for debugging purposes, particularly related to sorting functionality which were removed in later commits.  These logging statements were added and removed multiple times throughout the log.

**`safety-event-filters.component.ts` Changes:**

This component handles filtering options for safety events. There were no changes made in the component's functionality; all the modifications were minor formatting changes.

**Overall Pattern:**

The changes primarily focus on refining the functionality and presentation of the safety event table and filters. Multiple minor changes were made to the `safety-event-table.component.html` file in quick succession, possibly indicating iterative improvements to the UI. The additions to and removal of debugging console log statements indicates an iterative debugging process. The addition of `infractionScore` to `sortFieldMap` suggests a feature enhancement to allow sorting by infraction score.
